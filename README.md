In this project, I implemented a Path Tracer using the CUDA parallel computing platform. Path Tracing is a computer graphics Monte Carlo method of rendering images of three-dimensional scenes such that the global illumination is faithful to reality. 

# Path Tracing Intro


## Features

### Basic Path Tracing

### Stream Compaction, Caching, & Sorting Optimizations

### 3D Model Importing (.obj)

### Anti-Aliasing

### Depth of Field

### Materials Support
#### Diffuse
#### Specular Reflective
#### Specular Refractive
#### Transmissive using Schlick's Approximation

Many more features can extend my implementation (such as texture importing, normal mapping, subsurface scattering, etc...).
